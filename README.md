# HANDY explorer
Tunable simulation of population dynamics.  This follows version 1.0 of "Human and nature dynamics" (HANDY)[1], modeling social inequality, resource use, and the collapse or survival of societies.

Any errors are mine (AW).  If the math is unfaithful to the original, it should be corrected.
